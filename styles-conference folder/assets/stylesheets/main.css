/*CSS RESETS: Every web browser has its own default styles for different elements. 
How Google Chrome renders headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth 
may be different from how Internet Explorer does. To ensure cross-browser 
compatibility, CSS resets have become widely used.

CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and 
provide one unified style for all browsers. These resets generally involve 
removing any sizing, margins, paddings, or additional styles and toning 
these values down. Because CSS cascades from top to bottom—more on that 
soon—our reset needs to be at the very top of our style sheet.*/
